Application on Interrupts using INT0
INT0 pin is on PD2 and it's connected with a push Button 
I used INT0 in falling edge sense control 

#Microcontroller
The microcontroller used is ATMEGA32 
#peripherals

In this project, I used some peripherals 

I used two LEDs
 -RED_LED      
  The CPU  Turns it ON  and The interrupt turns it OFF 
 _BLUE_LED 
  The Interrupt (INT0) turns it ON
 
 #Tools 

 #eclipse 
 #Proteus to simulate the project
